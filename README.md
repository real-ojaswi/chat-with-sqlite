# Chat-App with SQLite files

As I had to deal with a lot of SQLite files in my work, quickly created a basic chat application that runs on Streamlit. Chat prompts and tools can be modified to better match the use cases.
Helpful 5-hour project to save several hours at work and to stay up-to-date with the latest langchain release.
